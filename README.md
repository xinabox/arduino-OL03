## About the OL03
This ☒CHIP forms part of the output modules and is equipped with a high speed PWM IO expander chip. The OL03 module provides both power conversion accepting either 12V or 24V as well as PWM strip light control.

The OL03 ☒CHIP is housed in an compact 2U×4U chip with four connection ports.

The OL03 is based on the FAN5702 6-LED driver. The datasheet can be viewed here [FAN5702](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/adc081c021.pdf).
